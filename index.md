#### rsk platform is, at its core, the combination of:
* A Turing-complete resource-accounted deterministic virtual machine (for smart contracts)
* A two-way pegged Bitcoin Sidechain (for BTC denominated exchange) based on a Federation secured with custom Hardware Security Modules (HSM's). Once the drivechain protocol becomes implemented on Bitcoin, there are plans to move to a hybrid- drivechain mechanism)
* A selfish-mining resistant merge-mining-based consensus protocol
* A low-latency block-propagation network (for fast payments)
